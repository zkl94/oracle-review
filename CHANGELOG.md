# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Claude: add `--engine browser --model claude-fable-5-1` with verified Max effort, inline text evidence, Markdown capture, saved-turn recovery and follow-ups through the signed-in website. Keep upstream 6 Pro support unchanged.

## 0.21.1 - 2026-09-14

**Highlights:** Live Gemini answers work out of the box.

- Gemini: accept Google's large security and reporting response headers automatically so live web answers work without a Node header-limit workaround, including through remote hosts.
- Remote: dispatch Gemini browser models through the host's Gemini web executor for new runs and restarts, preserve host-only authentication and Gemini text options, and support the host's running Chrome connection. Fixes #392; thanks @solomonneas.

## 0.21.0 - 2026-09-14

**Highlights:** Opt-in ChatGPT conversation records and independent turn digests provide evidence of answer fidelity.

- Browser: optionally save ChatGPT’s verbatim conversation record and independent turn digests, with answer fidelity evidence and best-effort fallback; thanks @frontierkodiak.

## 0.20.3 - 2026-09-13

**Highlights:** Gemini is selected consistently across CLI, MCP, and detached workers; cookie values are redacted from verbose logs.

- Browser: select Gemini consistently for local CLI, MCP, and detached workers, preserve saved Gemini options and HTTP cancellation, and reject unsupported remote Gemini requests before submission.

**Highlights:** Fewer Chrome approval prompts, reliable browser harvest recovery, and generated-image delivery across remote hosts.

- Browser: reuse one DevTools connection per browser endpoint and Oracle process across discovery, page sessions, and service requests, while keeping cancellation local and reconnecting after a real disconnect. Fixes #484.
- Browser: recover saved attach-running conversations through refreshed browser WebSocket metadata, keep transient status notices out of prompt verification, and report actionable harvest errors. Fixes #482.
- Remote: transfer generated images to the requested client path and numbered siblings, require image-capable hosts before submission, and omit host-only save locations from answers; thanks @malvarezcastillo.
- Browser: warn before an implicit default switches away from a visibly newer selected model, including delayed picker rendering, while preserving explicit models, saved preferences, and current-model behavior. Fixes #375.
- Browser: recognize the exact Korean Latest label (`최신`) during selection and verification; thanks @thisisjun786.

- Browser: verify Extra High on quota-limited four-tier effort sliders and reject unavailable Pro before input or submission. Fixes #472; thanks @ventianima-lab.
- CLI: preserve explicitly requested Pro effort over saved browser defaults while retaining explicit effort overrides and config-only preferences; thanks @pdurlej.
- Browser: retry unavailable controller identity probes instead of caching failures for the process lifetime, and stabilize native Windows lease verification.
- Dependencies: refresh OpenAI, Zod, Inquirer, TokenTally, Node types, formatting/lint tooling, and the pinned Chrome DevTools protocol while retaining Node >=24 and the two-day release-age policy.

## 0.20.0 - 2026-09-07

**Highlights:** GPT-6 Astra API and ChatGPT Latest support, explicit Web Search, and safe cleanup after browser recovery.

- API/browser: support GPT-6 Astra with model-specific reasoning validation, ChatGPT Latest selection, localized effort controls, and verified Pro requests; preserve browser aliases during CLI engine discovery. Thanks @oraclexing, @malvarezcastillo, @FNDEVVE, and @kiyo-e.
- Browser: add the opt-in --browser-research search mode and MCP equivalent, verifying the English Web Search hint and staged prompt before sending, including bundled attachments; thanks @DragonFSKY.
- Browser: let incomplete controllers exit without losing recoverable tabs, then retire explicitly owned tabs only after recovered answers and completed sessions are saved; preserve borrowed, kept, generating, reclaimed, and actively controlled targets. Fixes #435; thanks @lhysin.
- Browser: capture visible Deep Research plan titles, steps, and planning/researching state, skip an already-finished countdown, and preserve existing session-status and submission behavior; thanks @oraclexing.

- Dependencies: update Sweet Cookie to 0.4.3 and TokenTally to 0.1.5 while retaining Node >=24 and the two-day release-age policy.

## 0.19.0 - 2026-09-07

**Highlights:** Durable detached MCP consultations, modern and legacy MCP client support, and clearer browser capture failures with preserved recovery evidence.

- MCP: start local consultations with opt-in detached workers and wait for durable completion without cancelling the run when a client times out, cancels a wait, or reconnects. Fixes #429; thanks @oraclexing.
- MCP: support the modern 2026-07-28 protocol through SDK v2 while preserving legacy stdio clients, tool contracts, session resources, and request-scoped progress logging. Fixes #360; thanks @fredluz.
- Browser: keep attachment uploads and sends in the original chat, validate exact controls at delivery, and stop context/focus races without replaying a dispatched action; thanks @oraclexing.
- Browser: optionally export captured downloadable files beside --write-output with --write-artifacts, preserving canonical artifacts, validating hashes, and avoiding filename collisions; thanks @gwelinder.
- Browser: persist and display thinking-effort selection evidence, including remote results, without treating unverified or disabled options as confirmed selections; thanks @frontierkodiak.
- Remote: add opt-in bounded concurrent run admission with FIFO queuing, host-cap enforcement, cancellation, and isolated artifacts while preserving default single-flight HTTP 409 behavior; thanks @frontierkodiak.
- Remote: honor the service host’s attach-running, remote-Chrome, and approval-wait settings, reusing its signed-in browser without launching a separate manual-login Chrome while keeping routing under host control.
- Browser: preserve shared Chrome across concurrent manual-login controllers, verify final lease ownership before shutdown, and harden lock recovery against transient process probes; thanks @oraclexing.
- Browser: make each Chrome remote-debugging approval wait configurable with --browser-approval-wait, preserve the 20-second default, and show progress while waiting for per-connection approval.
- Browser: wait for effort slider controls to mount and become visible before selecting the requested tier; thanks @ShunmeiCho.
- Browser: detect when a later harvest conflicts with saved conversation identities, preserve the original transcript and answer, and record explicit manual target overrides. Fixes #442; thanks @postoso.
- Browser: fail promptly on known English Retry failures, preserve manual recovery, and keep waiting while generation remains active; apply the same guard to image output and response recovery. Fixes #457; thanks @developerisnow.
- Gemini: update the web request protocol and model headers, preserve raw image-download fallbacks, report upstream and oversized-header failures clearly, and add an opt-in refusal of model fallback; thanks @mpeter.
- Browser: bundle multiple source uploads while preserving native attachments and the existing auto format, negotiate deferred fallback bundling with remote hosts, and remove generated files after success, failure, or preparation timeout; thanks @tristanmanchester.
- Agents: add the optional oracle-advisor skill with explicit API, browser, or render routing and per-run model/effort provenance, while retaining the existing Oracle skill. Fixes #355; thanks @genforAI.
- Browser: wait for explicit upload state to clear before completing attachments or sending; ignore unrelated activity, hidden indicators, and filenames that resemble status text. Fixes #446; thanks @HJC704.
- Browser: retain per-file attachment evidence, including filename-less images, and stabilize the send target without replaying a dispatched prompt. Fixes #418; thanks @hubofvalley.
- Browser: refuse default-tab fallback when an ordinary remote run cannot create or attach its dedicated tab; thanks @ShunmeiCho.
- **Breaking — Remote:** accept only conversation-scoped client settings; executable paths, profiles, debugging endpoints, cookie selection, existing-tab selection, and other host settings remain controlled by the service host. Thanks @frontierkodiak.
- Azure: ignore generic base URLs during model-metadata resolution, preventing OpenRouter catalog requests with Azure credentials.
- Browser: select and verify thinking effort in ChatGPT's direct slider while keeping explicit Pro requests fail-closed. Fixes #422.
- Browser: recognize Korean picker labels and localized effort-label punctuation, including Japanese, without confusing High, Extra High, or Unicode word continuations. Fixes #423 and #440; thanks @Gabrielgvl and @kiyo-e.
- Browser: recognize the Japanese 思考量 effort label and Japanese archive controls.
- Browser: honor the requested thinking time during Deep Research.
- CLI: inherit browser.remoteChrome from user configuration while preserving explicit endpoints, attach-running destinations, and copy-profile choices; thanks @ShunmeiCho.
- Browser: attach to running Chrome without DevToolsActivePort metadata, with IPv6 support and bounded endpoint retries. Fixes #414; thanks @devYRPauli.
- Remote: preserve every attachment when upload basenames collide after sanitization. Fixes #387; thanks @postoso.
- Browser: recognize collision-renamed attachment chips while keeping filenames, extensions, and Unicode boundaries distinct. Fixes #393; thanks @devYRPauli.
- Browser: report ChatGPT rate limiting directly instead of presenting the modal's dismissal button as an available model.
- Browser: retire dead running-session records when only the controller PID is available. Fixes #391; thanks @OfficialAbhinavSingh.
- Browser: bound prompt preparation by the configured input timeout. Fixes #381.
- Browser: restore visible macOS Chrome windows to their prior placement only when Oracle recorded that placement before hiding them.
- CLI: keep dry-run previews free of session side effects.
- Remote: advertise only addresses on which the service is listening.
- Release: attach the npm tarball and its checksums to the GitHub Release and verify them before the Homebrew tap updates, so the formula no longer points at a missing asset. Fixes #443.
- Dependencies: refresh provider SDKs, browser and terminal utilities, schema/query tooling, development dependencies, pnpm, and Pages actions; update OpenAI to 7.10, Google GenAI to 2.21, Inquirer to 14.2.1, Puppeteer to 25.10, Fast URI to 4.1.4, Vitest to 5, and Chrome DevTools protocol to 0.0.1692173 while retaining Node >=24 and the two-day release-age policy.

## 0.18.0 — 2026-08-14

### Changed

- Browser: stop copying cookies from a live Chrome profile by default because ChatGPT token rotation can invalidate the user's interactive session. Use the persistent `--browser-manual-login` profile (recommended), inline cookies, or explicitly restore the old behavior with `--browser-cookie-sync` / `browser.cookieSync=true`. Fixes #367.
- Browser: route the generic current-Pro aliases (`gpt-5-pro`, `gpt-5.1-pro`, `gpt-5.2-pro`, and `gpt-5.4-pro`) to GPT-5.6 Sol with Pro effort. Use the explicit `gpt-5.5-pro` model to keep the historical GPT-5.5 target; an explicit thinking-time setting still overrides the alias default. Fixes #373. Thanks @pdurlej!

### Fixed

- Browser: detect a disabled ChatGPT effort tier (e.g. an exhausted Pro allotment) before clicking it, and report the account's own reset notice instead of a misleading "selection unverified" failure. Thanks @enieuwy!

## 0.17.3 — 2026-08-13

**Highlight:** browser-mode answers and recovery are reliable again — no more
discarded responses, and authenticated sessions survive a reattach.

### Fixed

- Browser: treat the skip-ahead control labels as placeholder signals only when the entire turn text is short chrome text, so substantial assistant answers that mention those labels are no longer discarded.
- Browser: align reattach recovery cookie sync with the launch path for manual-login profiles with explicit cookie sync, so recovery can reopen an authenticated conversation with supplied cookies instead of skipping sync. Thanks @enieuwy!
- Browser: recognize the Japanese `詳細設定` → `推論レベル` controls in ChatGPT's unified Intelligence picker, allowing explicit Pro effort selection without weakening the fail-closed guard for unknown languages. Thanks @kiyo-e!
- Browser: honor explicit `--browser-headless` for locally launched Chrome/Chromium binaries while preserving the headful default. Explicit `--browser-headless` still conflicts with `--browser-attach-running`; a saved `browser.headless` preference is ignored in attach-running mode. Thanks @enieuwy!

## 0.17.2 — 2026-08-10

**Highlight:** browser mode works with ChatGPT's redesigned model picker again —
model selection moved under Advanced → Model, and the `gpt-*-pro` aliases now
select the right model _and_ the Pro effort tier.

### Fixed

- Browser: navigate ChatGPT's unified picker, where the model version lives under Advanced → Model and effort under Advanced → Effort. The `gpt-5.5-pro` family of aliases now resolves to the GPT-5.5 model with Pro thinking time instead of failing against the removed flat menu; an explicit `--browser-thinking-time` still wins (#362, thanks @shivamiitgoa).
- Security: restrict existing and newly created session transcripts, model metadata, and browser artifacts to the current user, without following symlinks during upgrade hardening. Thanks @bunlongheng!

### Added

- Browser: a `pro` thinking-time level that selects ChatGPT's Pro effort tier on the model it is already using. It fails closed: an unconfirmed selection aborts the run rather than silently submitting at a cheaper tier.

### Changed

- Dependencies: update Google GenAI, Node types, Chrome DevTools protocol, esbuild, tsx, shiki, tokentally (now pricing cached tokens), hono, protobufjs, vite, and related transitives.
- Developer workflow: remove the obsolete scoped-commit helper and allow standard Git commands in isolated worktrees.

## 0.17.1 — 2026-08-02

### Changed

- Dependencies: update OpenAI, Markdansi, Shiki, Hono, Fast URI, protobufjs, Vite, Puppeteer, Chrome DevTools protocol, Oxc tooling, tsx, and pnpm.

### Fixed

- Browser: keep `--browser-thinking-time extra-high` as Extra High (non-Pro) on GPT-5.6 Sol instead of selecting Pro. Fixes #353.
- Browser: match German Intelligence effort labels with whole-word Latin matching, and keep the currently selected effort when a requested tier has no matching row. Thanks @Jonasdero!

## 0.17.0 — 2026-08-02

### Added

- API: add explicit GPT-5.6 reasoning mode and effort controls, including Pro mode, session persistence, long-run handling, and fail-closed route validation. Thanks @enki!

### Changed

- Dependencies: update Google GenAI, MCP SDK, OpenAI, Chalk, Shiki, TokenTally, Puppeteer, Chrome DevTools protocol, Oxc tooling, and related packages.

### Docs

- Rewrite the README around a verified install and quickstart, with detailed workflows linked to the docs site.

### Fixed

- Browser: reject retired GPT-5.2 base, Instant, and Thinking aliases before launching Chrome while keeping API aliases and legacy Pro routing. Fixes #344. Thanks @HidakaKoyo!
- Browser: preserve authenticated model-picker errors instead of appending a misleading cookie/login hint after login has already been verified.
- Browser: distinguish requested CLI model keys from verified ChatGPT picker labels without inferring a server-side GPT version from a generic label. Fixes #317. Thanks @DragonFSKY!
- Browser: recognize GPT-5.6 Sol as the selected model when ChatGPT exposes Pro in its independent effort pill. Thanks @jung0han!
- Browser: treat WSL's systemd-resolved loopback DNS stub as localhost when connecting to a freshly launched Chrome DevTools endpoint. Thanks @Rokurolize!
- CLI: reject junk between duration tokens and warn when malformed browser duration flags fall back to defaults. Thanks @devYRPauli!
- Browser: run long local Pro consultations in a detached worker while the CLI remains attached to its session log, so unexpected foreground termination cannot stop answer capture; Ctrl-C still cancels the worker. Thanks @Rokurolize!
- Browser: recognize ChatGPT's separate Pro effort control as the selected maximum effort for GPT-5.6 Sol when `--browser-thinking-time heavy` is requested. Thanks @Rokurolize!
- Gemini: type `.mp4`, `.mov`, and `.webm` uploads as video so Gemini receives them instead of silently discarding generic binary uploads. Thanks @mkubenka!
- Browser: wait for saved conversation turns to hydrate before retrying capture after a reload or reattach, and reject shell-only stop controls as recovery evidence. Thanks @pdurlej!

## 0.16.1 — 2026-07-23

### Changed

- Dependencies: refresh Google GenAI, OpenAI, Clipboardy, Chrome DevTools protocol, Hono/MCP runtime security fixes, Oxc tooling, and TSX.

### Fixed

- Browser: ignore transient `/c/WEB:<request-id>` routes until ChatGPT exposes the durable conversation URL, preventing completed GPT-5.6 and Pro answers from hanging until timeout under a mismatched response scope. Fixes #333. Thanks @dbachko and @kesslerio!
- Browser: recover completed answers after a recoverable DevTools disconnect by confirming target liveness and attempting bounded reattachment, while preserving fail-closed handling for unavailable targets. Fixes #326. Thanks @piyushbag!
- CLI: avoid inheriting `browser.thinkingTime` from config when `--browser-model-strategy current` is explicit, while preserving an explicit `--browser-thinking-time` override. Thanks @jung0han!
- Browser/Serve: keep the authenticated manual-login Chrome process alive while closing each successfully captured service-owned run tab, preventing renderer and memory accumulation across repeated remote consultations without changing explicit `--browser-keep-browser`, attached-tab, or incomplete-run recovery behavior. Thanks @rtl-ai!

## 0.16.0 — 2026-07-12

### Added

- Browser: allow `ORACLE_BROWSER_MAX_CONCURRENT_TABS` to set the per-host shared-profile tab cap while preserving explicit config precedence and the default limit. Thanks @StartupBros!
- Browser: detect ChatGPT's active Chat/Work mode before new browser runs, normalize Work pages and attached Work tabs to a new Chat with verified trusted input, and preserve explicit resume safety. Fixes #315. Thanks @DragonFSKY!

### Fixed

- Browser: scope the fallback stop-control selector to the composer so read-aloud, dictation, and voice controls cannot hold completed responses open until timeout. Thanks @StartupBros!
- Browser: support ChatGPT GPT-5.6's unified Intelligence picker, where the menu wraps `composer-intelligence-picker-content` and the highest effort is labeled `Pro` instead of `Pro Extended`; recognize the current Chinese effort labels (`极速5.5`, `中`, `高`, and `极高`) without prefix collisions and verify switches against React-replaced composer pills. Fixes #303. Thanks @DragonFSKY!
- GPT-5.6: add first-class `gpt-5.6` and `gpt-5.6-sol` aliases for the OpenAI API and ChatGPT's Sol picker entry, including navigation through the current-version submenu and strict selection evidence that cannot be replaced by a localized effort label. Fixes #305. Thanks @DragonFSKY!
- Browser: keep hidden macOS Chrome windows rendered off-screen so trusted prompt submissions land without retaining drafts or leaking them into later runs. Fixes #298 and #312. Thanks @LeoLin990405!
- Browser: require positive terminal evidence before finalizing ChatGPT responses so settled preambles and mid-stream text cannot be captured as the completed answer. Thanks @StartupBros!
- Browser: distinguish genuine Cloudflare interstitials from healthy ChatGPT pages that carry bot-management scripts or mention generic challenge text. Thanks @StartupBros!
- Browser: recover completed Deep Research reports when the initial capture contains only the Deep Research App tool-call wrapper. Thanks @devYRPauli!

## 0.15.2 — 2026-07-06

### Changed

- Dependencies: update Google GenAI, OpenAI, Markdansi, osc-progress, Shiki, TokenTally, Vitest, Puppeteer, TypeScript native preview, Oxc tooling, and related packages.

### Fixed

- Browser: close the DevTools connection after live session reattach so the CLI exits instead of hanging after capture.
- Browser: persist late `/c/<id>` URLs during remote Chrome runs and prefer saved conversation targets over stale target IDs during reattach. Fixes #284. Thanks @LeoLin990405 and @StartupBros!
- Browser: keep prompt baselines, assistant snapshots, and artifact capture on one top-level ChatGPT turn index so nested message nodes cannot hide a new response. Thanks @cp7553479!
- Browser: reconfirm implausibly short ChatGPT captures after thinking-UI transitions, and fail closed rather than archiving when the response cannot be confirmed. Fixes #284. Thanks @LeoLin990405!
- Skills: remove personal credential-reveal and machine-local checkout instructions from the distributed Oracle skill. Fixes #292. Thanks @HikaruEgashira!

## 0.15.1 — 2026-07-03

### Added

- Bridge/Browser: transfer ChatGPT-generated files from the browser host back to the client over a token-protected artifact endpoint, with capability discovery, safe filenames, byte counts, SHA-256 metadata, ZIP validation, and manual fallback guidance for mixed-version bridge deployments. Thanks @DK625!
- API: add user-only `modelOverrides` for remapping known models and their metadata on custom OpenAI-compatible gateways. Fixes #273. Thanks @wangwllu!

### Fixed

- Browser: retain runtime, model-selection, and redacted prompt-commit diagnostics in failed session metadata when ChatGPT submission verification times out. Fixes #286. Thanks @LeoLin990405!
- API: forward configured reasoning effort through custom OpenAI-compatible chat-completions gateways.
- Browser: clear stale ChatGPT temporary-conversation cookies before navigation while preserving keys for open or resumed conversations, preventing accumulated `conv_key_*` entries from triggering header-size failures. Thanks @jung0han!
- Browser: accept a stable, exact file-input name match when ChatGPT marks the composer ready but exposes no attachment chip or count, while still waiting through active uploads and rejecting missing or extra files. Fixes #275. Thanks @wangwllu!
- Browser: avoid returning truncated Pro answers when completion controls appear during the thinking-to-answer transition. Thanks @xuan-wei!
- Browser/Bridge: improve ChatGPT ZIP artifact capture before bridge transfer by broadening sandbox/file-card/download-control discovery, adding sanitized direct-download diagnostics, and falling back to scoped browser downloads when sandbox fetches fail. Thanks @DK625!
- Browser: wait up to eight seconds for the ChatGPT model/effort composer pill to mount before failing explicit selection, while leaving `option-not-found` failures immediate. Thanks @gustavosmendes!
- Browser: activate ChatGPT Deep Research after the final composer reset, select the current tools-menu row shape, and use trusted mouse clicks for Deep Research and send actions so the request reaches the real research-plan flow instead of being submitted as an ordinary Pro prompt. Fixes #281. Thanks @wbzjt!
- Browser: report `response streaming` when a visible stop control is the only remaining liveness signal, and share that signal with completion capture so selector drift cannot finalize a still-streaming answer. Refs #284. Thanks @StartupBros!

## 0.15.0 — 2026-06-19

### Added

- Browser: `--copy-profile <dir>` copies the active signed-in Chrome profile (or an explicit `--browser-chrome-profile`) to a throwaway profile and runs browser mode against it, reusing the live ChatGPT session with no manual sign-in. Skips keychain-mocking flags so encrypted cookies decrypt via the real Chrome "Safe Storage" key (macOS/Linux; requires `rsync`). The throwaway copy is always cleaned up, rejects incompatible persistent/existing/remote browser modes, and fails fast if the required `Local State` cannot be copied. Thanks @edwarddgao!

### Changed

- Dependencies: update Vitest, coverage tooling, Vite, Hono, and protobufjs to remove vulnerable transitive releases.

### Fixed

- Browser: wait for the current ChatGPT Intelligence pill before falling back to the default thinking level, and make `--browser-model-strategy select` prefer concrete requested variants over version-only submenu wrappers with bounded retries. This lets current-model runs select and verify Extra High before submitting and prevents explicit Instant selection from hanging (thanks @alex-on-java and @servrox).
- Browser: save ChatGPT generated-file button downloads sequentially, preserve browser-provided filenames for generic endpoints, and stop after a timed-out download so late completions cannot be attributed to the next file. Thanks @orbitingflea!
- Browser: reject Deep Research planning/status captures and fail clearly when ChatGPT silently returns a normal response without observable research activity, instead of saving either as the final report. Fixes #261. Thanks @aaronflorey!

## 0.14.1 — 2026-06-15

### Changed

- Dependencies: update sweet-cookie, Markdansi, osc-progress, esbuild, TypeScript native preview, es-toolkit, and related Node/Inquirer type packages.

### Fixed

- Browser: preserve original bytes when ZIP-bundling raw, archive, office, and media uploads; choose byte-preserving ZIPs automatically for mixed bundles while enforcing attachment and memory limits. Thanks @orbitingflea!
- Browser: select explicit Thinking model versions through ChatGPT's current `Configure...` Intelligence dialog, retain support for the earlier direct-version submenu, and require observable version evidence before reporting success. Thanks @aaronflorey!
- Browser: retry manual-login DevTools tab creation on fresh Chrome launches, recover ChatGPT generated-image downloads through the authenticated browser context when Node-side fetch fails, and keep generated-image artifact waits fail-fast on visible ChatGPT warnings. Thanks @derekszen!
- Browser: support ChatGPT's updated Intelligence model picker and Pro effort submenu, and accept `instant`, `medium`, `high`, and `extra-high` as thinking-time aliases while preserving existing Oracle names. Thanks @orbitingflea!

## 0.14.0 — 2026-06-12

### Added

- Browser: `oracle --followup <browser-session> -p ...` now safely reopens the exact saved ChatGPT conversation, inherits its browser profile/configuration/model, and fails closed before submitting to the wrong thread; browser failures/timeouts print `--render`, `--live`, and `--harvest` reattach commands with the real session slug. Thanks @hbruceweaver and @pdurlej!
- Browser: clean stale manual-login Chrome profile locks before relaunching browser and Project Sources runs, while preserving locks when the recorded Chrome process is still alive. Thanks @derekszen!
- Browser: `oracle session <id> --harvest` and `--live` now auto-recover when the original Chrome has been closed by relaunching the manual-login profile and reopening the saved conversation URL, then retrying the harvest against the recovered tab. Resolves the failure mode where a long GPT-5 Pro Extended response completed in the background after the CLI's 20-minute wall expired and the conversation was archived. Recovery URL selection prefers `browser.harvest.url` over `browser.runtime.tabUrl` and is gated by a shared ChatGPT-conversation-URL check (rejects home, project shell, and external URLs so the persistent profile can't be navigated to the wrong page from stale metadata). Opt out with `--no-recover` on the `session` subcommand.
- Browser: persist ChatGPT-generated downloadable files such as CSV, PDF, ZIP, wheel, and source-distribution outputs beside the session transcript, limited to current-run assistant artifacts and known ChatGPT file endpoints. Fixes #244. Thanks @pdurlej!
- MCP: add a dedicated `chatgpt_image` tool plus `generateImage` / `outputPath` support in `consult` so agent callers can trigger ChatGPT image generation and receive saved local artifacts in typed structured output. Thanks @umutkeltek!

### Fixed

- Browser/MCP: save ChatGPT image-generation responses delivered as current-turn “Download…” behavior buttons, validating downloaded bytes as real images before returning typed artifacts instead of waiting for an inline image until timeout.
- Gemini: refresh browser mappings for Gemini 3.1 Flash-Lite, Gemini 3.5 Flash, Gemini 3.1 Pro, and Pro Deep Think; add current Flash API model configs; keep legacy browser aliases working; and make the live text smoke fail on stale mappings instead of skipping. Fixes #242. Thanks @goldengrape!
- Browser: restore Deep Research report capture from ChatGPT's out-of-process report iframe, prefer completed page-scoped reads with legacy frame fallback, and bind/filter CDP auto-attach by the active page session so other tabs or unrelated iframes cannot be harvested. Thanks @umutkeltek!
- API/OpenRouter: parse catalog prompt/completion prices as USD-per-token strings, preserving model/context metadata and accurate cost estimates while malformed prices fall back cleanly. Thanks @devYRPauli!
- Browser: honor `--browser-model-strategy current` when ChatGPT exposes a usable composer without a model-picker button, record unavailable current-model labels honestly, and keep strict selection failures actionable. Thanks @m-rousseau!
- Browser: select and verify requested thinking effort from ChatGPT's standalone Pro/Thinking composer pills and earlier Intelligence/per-model picker layouts, keep Pro Extended fail-closed when the selected effort cannot be confirmed, and ignore status-only assistant turns such as `Pro thinking` only while generation is active; picker failures now emit a bounded, redacted diagnostic in normal session logs. Thanks @umutkeltek!
- Browser: surface visible ChatGPT rate-limit, temporary-unavailable, and authentication/challenge warnings in assistant-timeout errors and session metadata instead of reporting only a generic timeout. Thanks @derekszen!
- Browser: verify ChatGPT login through the cookie-authenticated `/api/auth/session` endpoint before falling back to the legacy `/backend-api/me` probe and strong app-shell signals, avoiding false “session not detected” failures when the legacy endpoint requires bearer auth. Fixes #241. Thanks @hexsprite and @orbitingflea!
- Browser: select ChatGPT “Welcome back” accounts only by exact configured email, keep the address out of logs, and fail closed on ambiguous saved accounts. Thanks @derekszen!
- Browser: relax pre-send readiness for Oracle-generated `attachments-bundle.txt` and `.zip` uploads when ChatGPT exposes only the `attachments-bundle` stem, while keeping filename-boundary checks so unrelated attachment names do not satisfy the gate. Thanks @ig0rsky!

### Changed

- CLI/API/Browser: render generated prompt, inline, and text-bundle context with stable line numbers so model answers can cite source as `path:line` or `path:line-line`, while preserving indexed `buildPrompt(...)` headings, raw browser uploads, ZIP entries, `createFileSections().sectionText`, and the default `formatFileSection(...)` output. Callers can request numbered output directly with `formatFileSection(..., { lineNumbers: true })`. Thanks @tristanmanchester!

### Security

- MCP: constrain image output paths to the symlink-safe `ORACLE_HOME_DIR/generated` directory by default, keeping agent writes away from Oracle config, session, and browser-profile state; explicit opt-in remains required for external paths.
- MCP: reject image output through the remote browser service until generated artifacts can be transferred back to the caller.

## 0.13.0 — 2026-05-22

### Added

- Browser: add `--browser-attachment-timeout`, `ORACLE_BROWSER_ATTACHMENT_TIMEOUT`, and `browser.attachmentTimeoutMs` so slow ChatGPT attachment uploads can extend the pre-send readiness gate and failures report the timeout budget. Fixes #214. Thanks @enieuwy!
- Browser: target ChatGPT's GPT-5.5 "Instant" picker row when `--model gpt-5.5-instant` (or label aliases like `"ChatGPT 5.5 Instant"` / `"5.5 fast"`) is requested, with dedicated picker testids so the selection no longer falls through to the bare 5.5 "Thinking" row. Browser-only; the API catalog is not modified. Thanks @LoukikNaik!

### Changed

- Config: layer safe project defaults from `.oracle/config.json` files discovered upward from the current working directory, so repos can pin workflow defaults like ChatGPT Project URLs without copying the user config.
- Website: point package/homepage metadata and generated site chrome at `https://askoracle.sh` instead of the GitHub repository.

### Fixed

- Browser: accept Cloudflare/throttling-blocked ChatGPT auth probes only when the signed-in app shell is visible, while keeping plain 401/403 login failures authoritative. Thanks @orbitingflea!
- Browser: resolve attachment readiness from the active ChatGPT composer so uploaded files do not false-fail with `attachment-send-not-ready` when the Send button is already clickable. Thanks @enieuwy!
- Browser: scope ChatGPT model picker scans to the real picker menu while preserving text-only fallback rows, so sidebar/search Radix menus do not block model selection. Thanks @orbitingflea!
- Browser: tolerate duplicate-renamed or ellipsized ChatGPT attachment chip names during pre-send readiness checks. Thanks @pdurlej!

## 0.12.1 — 2026-05-17

### Changed

- Docs: update the bundled Oracle skill for GPT-5.5 Pro and current provider/preflight/perf-trace guidance (#204). Thanks @TomBener!
- Dependencies: update transitive fast-uri, hono, ip-address, express-rate-limit, and Vite to patched versions for Dependabot alerts (#205, #206, #207).
- Dependencies: update Gemini, sweet-cookie, Puppeteer, Vitest, Inquirer, tsx, oxfmt/oxlint, DevTools Protocol, and related type/tooling packages (#209).
- Dependencies: update the OpenAI SDK and TypeScript native preview.

### Fixed

- MCP: keep local mcporter smokes from failing when the optional Chrome DevTools browser endpoint env var is unset.
- Sessions: allocate same-slug session directories atomically, recreate missing per-model log directories, and persist zombie/dead-browser status reconciliation from session listings.
- API: share provider route resolution between doctor/preflight and runtime requests so route diagnostics match real execution.
- CLI: rethrow sanitized multi-model provider failures without mutating or linking the raw provider error, keeping secrets out of logs and error chains.
- Browser: mark Chrome disconnects before a recoverable ChatGPT conversation as errors instead of leaving sessions running for impossible reattach. Thanks @pdurlej!
- Browser: fail closed when GPT-5.5 Pro Extended effort cannot be confirmed instead of silently submitting with the wrong or default effort. Thanks @pdurlej!
- Release: write clean checksum files from `scripts/release.sh artifacts` without helper trace lines.

## 0.12.0 — 2026-05-15

### Added

- CLI: add `--perf-trace` / `--perf-trace-path` / `ORACLE_PERF_TRACE` startup timing traces and lazy-load heavy browser/provider/runtime modules to reduce time-to-first-output.
- API: add `--allow-partial` / `--partial ok` for multi-model runs so advisory panels can exit 0 when at least one model succeeds, while still listing saved outputs and a JSON output manifest before failures.
- API: classify common provider failures in multi-model summaries and metadata, including auth, expired keys, quota, rate limits, and unavailable models, with secret-safe recovery hints.
- API: add root `--preflight` provider readiness checks and packed CLI help smoke coverage so stale installed help is caught before release.
- Sessions: print and persist a compact lifecycle block showing foreground/background execution, detach state, model count, and reattach command.
- Docs: add `oracle docs check` / `pnpm docs:check` to catch documented flags that are missing from Commander help metadata.
- Docs: document provider preflight, route diagnostics, partial multi-model recovery, and output manifest workflows in README/provider docs.
- API: add `--provider openai` / `--no-azure` to force first-party OpenAI when Azure env/config is present, add `oracle doctor --providers` and `--route` redacted route diagnostics, keep provider-qualified model IDs on OpenRouter/proxy routes instead of accidental Azure/native routes, and fail early when Azure routing lacks a deployment.
- Browser/MCP: add opt-in ZIP formatting for bundled browser uploads with `--browser-bundle-format zip` / `browserBundleFormat: "zip"`, preserving individual file names in one ChatGPT attachment.

### Fixed

- CLI: make missing-prompt help exit nonzero, reject `--dry-run --render` like `--dry-run --render-markdown`, and terminate promptly with code 130 on SIGINT.
- API: parse duration-style `--timeout` values such as `10m`, derive the HTTP transport timeout and stale-session cutoff from explicit overall timeouts, and warn when an explicit shorter `--http-timeout` can fail first.
- Browser: select thinking effort from the currently checked ChatGPT model row so Pro Extended runs do not fall back to the Thinking row's effort control.
- Browser: record ChatGPT model-selection evidence in session metadata and CLI output so Pro browser runs show the selected model proof (#195). Thanks @pdurlej!
- Browser: target ChatGPT's renamed bare Pro picker row for Pro browser runs while keeping older Pro CLI aliases mapped to the current browser target (#190, fixes #182). Thanks @jungdaesuh!
- Browser: recognize current ChatGPT attachment chips without treating stale page-level chips as ready, and keep the longer send-button wait scoped to attachment uploads (#192). Thanks @li-aolong!

## 0.11.1 — 2026-05-10

### Changed

- Dependencies: update Google GenAI, OpenAI, Zod, Puppeteer, and developer tooling packages. (#187)

### Fixed

- Browser/MCP: avoid false ChatGPT login prompts when sidebar history starts with "Login..." and default MCP browser consults to manual login on Windows. (#189) — thanks @ndycode.
- Browser/MCP: fail fast when a manual-login browser profile has not been initialized or signed in, and show first-time setup guidance for the private Oracle Chrome profile used by Claude/Codex MCP consults.
- Browser: allow Pro model selection in ChatGPT Temporary Chat URLs and skip archive attempts for temporary conversations. (#185) — thanks @pdurlej.
- Browser: recognize ChatGPT's renamed GPT-5.5 Pro/Thinking model labels and always apply requested thinking time instead of assuming Pro implies Extended. (#183, fixes #182) — thanks @broady.
- CLI/Browser: expose `--max-file-size-bytes` on normal `oracle --file` runs, preserve the CLI override ahead of config/env defaults, and pass the raised cap through browser prompt assembly.
- MCP: reject unknown `consult` fields instead of silently ignoring misspelled tool-call arguments. (#184) — thanks @pdurlej.

### Docs

- Website: highlight code blocks in the generated docs site.

### CI

- Install dependencies before building the docs site and update the Homebrew tap after releases.

## 0.11.0 — 2026-05-07

### Added

- Browser/MCP: add non-destructive ChatGPT Project Sources management (`oracle project-sources list|add`, MCP `project_sources`) so Developer Mode workflows can share explicit project context through Sources. Addresses #131 and builds on #132 by @vgorlovi.
- Browser: add repeatable `--browser-follow-up` prompts and MCP `browserFollowUps` for multi-turn ChatGPT browser consults in one conversation. (#170) — thanks @pdurlej.
- Browser: add live ChatGPT tab inspection, `oracle status --browser-tabs`, browser session harvest/live-tail commands, and `--browser-tab <ref>` to reuse an existing ChatGPT tab by current tab, target id, URL, or title substring. (#126) — thanks @NathanSkene.
- Browser: add `--browser-research deep` / MCP `browserResearchMode: "deep"` for ChatGPT Deep Research browser runs, including progress monitoring, reattach recovery, and iframe report capture. (#151) — thanks @pdurlej.
- Browser: save durable browser session artifacts, including transcripts, Deep Research reports, and ChatGPT-generated image files when downloadable image URLs are present. (#169) — thanks @pdurlej.
- Browser: add `--browser-archive` / MCP `browserArchive` to archive successful one-shot ChatGPT browser runs after local artifacts are saved. (#178) — thanks @pdurlej.
- Browser: add `--browser-attach-running` to reuse a local already-running signed-in Chrome through Chrome's local remote-debugging toggle. Oracle opens a dedicated tab, stores attach metadata for reattach, and leaves the browser itself untouched. (#119) — thanks @dedene.
- MCP: add the `chatgpt-pro-heavy` consult preset, MCP dry-runs, browser model strategy passthrough, and `oracle bridge claude-config --local-browser` for Claude Code + local ChatGPT Pro browser consults. (#149) — thanks @pdurlej.
- Browser: coordinate concurrent ChatGPT browser runs that share one manual-login profile with a tab lease registry, `--browser-max-concurrent-tabs`, stale lease cleanup, and shared Chrome discovery. (#150) — thanks @pdurlej.
- Browser: print a browser control plan before ChatGPT runs and dry-runs, and clean up leftover blank tabs after completed manual-profile runs. (#179) — thanks @pdurlej.
- Browser: document multi-turn consult guardrails and make browser dry-runs explicit that Oracle only sends caller-provided follow-up prompts. (#180) — thanks @pdurlej.

### Docs

- Browser: document the new attach-running workflow and add a manual smoke test for the direct attach path.
- Website: add the generated askoracle.dev docs site, social preview asset, and GitHub Pages deployment workflow.

### Changed

- Browser: emit `--heartbeat` status while waiting for ChatGPT browser responses, including safe Thinking/Reasoning sidecar liveness metadata without logging reasoning text. (#148) — thanks @pdurlej.

### Fixed

- Browser/MCP: harden ChatGPT Pro browser consults with louder GPT-5.5 Pro selection validation, resolved MCP dry-run details, assistant-timeout diagnostics, incomplete-capture reattach metadata, and clean Pro Extended live-run metadata. (#177) — thanks @pdurlej.
- Browser: clear stale ChatGPT composer drafts before initial browser submissions and ignore model-picker thinking-effort controls while scanning model rows. (#176) — thanks @oirehT.
- Browser: keep the completed conversation tab open when `--browser-keep-browser` is set so `oracle status --browser-tabs`, harvest, and `--browser-tab current` can inspect/reuse it.
- Browser: retry Chrome remote-debugging approval `403` responses for `--browser-attach-running` and report the actionable approval/toggle guidance instead of a raw websocket error.
- Browser: fail fast when ChatGPT shows an account security block during Deep Research, instead of waiting until the research timeout.
- Browser: strengthen live upload verification so smoke tests catch cases where ChatGPT accepts a file chip but cannot read the uploaded content.
- Bridge: keep generated Codex/Claude MCP config snippets clean on stdout so redirecting `oracle bridge claude-config --local-browser > .mcp.json` produces valid JSON.
- MCP: clarify `consult` engine defaults and add ChatGPT browser-mode recovery guidance to missing GPT API-key errors. (#172) — thanks @pdurlej.

## 0.10.0 — 2026-05-04

### Changed

- OpenAI: switch the default model to `gpt-5.5-pro`, add explicit `gpt-5.5` support, and roll older Pro CLI aliases (`gpt-5.1-pro`, `gpt-5.2-pro`) forward to the current Pro API target.
- Browser: target ChatGPT `GPT-5.5 Pro` by default for Pro browser runs and recognize current GPT-5.5 picker labels such as `Pro Extended` and `Thinking Heavy`.
- Dependencies: update the npm dependency set.

### Fixed

- Gemini web: prefer the latest non-empty streaming response chunk so `gemini-3-pro` and `gemini-3.1-pro` browser runs do not report `(no text output)` when the first chunk is an empty placeholder. (#153, #154) — thanks @manhtruong03.
- Browser: keep ChatGPT cookie sync to the minimal auth/Cloudflare set by default, preventing oversized request headers from breaking browser runs after login.
- Browser: recover missing project/workspace URLs by resetting the tab before falling back to the base ChatGPT URL.
- Browser: recognize uploaded attachments from current ChatGPT file-chip labels, wait for a clickable send button, and continue when ChatGPT omits sent-message attachment UI after upload has already completed.
- Browser: reattach completed Pro sessions by anchoring response capture to the matching prompt turn instead of filtering out already-visible answers.
- CLI: avoid loading `clipboardy` during startup and add `/usr/sbin` before lazy clipboard loading on Intel macOS, preventing `spawnSync sysctl ENOENT` crashes from transitive architecture detection. (#129)
- Browser: track ChatGPT's composer rewrite by matching the new `__composer-pill` model button and selecting thinking effort from the model menu's per-row effort control, with bilingual label matching and old-chip fallback. (#146) — thanks @SyntaxSmith.
- Browser: open isolated local browser tabs directly on the configured ChatGPT URL instead of starting at `about:blank` and navigating later. (#139) — thanks @betamod.
- MCP: prevent the stdio server from auto-starting a second time when imported by an `oracle-mcp` bin shim. (#137) — thanks @SyntaxSmith.
- Gemini web: honor resolved manual-login browser profile directories when launching Gemini browser sessions. (#124) — thanks @blackopsrepl.
- Browser: avoid Linux hidden-home temp dirs for ephemeral Chrome profiles and redact inline cookie values in low-level debug config logs. (#136) — thanks @lodekeeper.
- Browser: fail attachment submissions before send instead of falling back to Enter after upload/send-readiness timeouts. (#115, #116) — thanks @HeMuling.
- Browser: stabilize localized ChatGPT model selection when the header stays generic by waiting on composer-footer model state changes. (#118) — thanks @dedene.
- CLI: accept `-p -` / `--prompt -` to read the prompt from stdin. (#117) — thanks @frankekn.
- Browser: preserve prompt-too-large fallback recovery after a dead-composer retry. (#117) — thanks @frankekn.
- Browser: guard assistant response capture against stale turns from a different ChatGPT conversation. (#117) — thanks @frankekn.
- Browser: verify sent attachments against the expected user turn instead of stale earlier turns. (#117) — thanks @frankekn.

## 0.9.0 — 2026-03-08

### Changed

- OpenAI: switch the default Pro target from `gpt-5.2-pro` to `gpt-5.4-pro`, add explicit `gpt-5.4` support, roll `gpt-5.1-pro` and `gpt-5.2-pro` forward to `gpt-5.4-pro`, keep provider-qualified custom ids intact, and map browser default Pro selection to ChatGPT `GPT-5.4 Pro` (#107, thanks @jameskraus).

### Fixed

- Gemini web: add Deep Think DOM automation for browser/manual-login runs, keep Deep Think browser-only, and honor configured browser timeouts/profile reuse semantics. (#97) — thanks @kanlanc.
- Browser: leave headful Chrome/profile state running when a Cloudflare anti-bot challenge interrupts browser mode, and record reuse guidance in the saved session metadata. (#111) — thanks @WinnCook.
- Browser: keep manual-login sessions reattachable when Chrome disconnects with the DevTools "Inspected target navigated or closed" error. (#110) — thanks @WinnCook.
- Gemini API: add explicit `gemini-3.1-pro` alias support, map it to Google's preview model id, and keep it API-only so browser runs do not silently target the wrong Gemini web model. (#100, #101) — thanks @ninjaa.
- API: route Gemini and Claude through chat/completions-compatible proxies when `--base-url` targets OpenRouter or another OpenAI-style endpoint, and keep explicit Claude base URLs from being overwritten by env defaults. (#95) — thanks @thesobercoder.
- Azure: route Responses API runs through Azure's `/openai/v1` endpoint and honor `--azure-deployment` as the dispatched model name. (#92) — thanks @yellowgolfball.
- CLI: make the per-file `--file` size guard configurable via `ORACLE_MAX_FILE_SIZE_BYTES` or `maxFileSizeBytes` in `~/.oracle/config.json`, and persist that limit for restarts. (#76)
- CLI: scope `--followup` to the OpenAI/Azure Responses path so Gemini, Claude, and custom `--base-url` adapters fail fast instead of silently starting a fresh run. (#105) — thanks @cheulyop.
- Gemini web: include upload MIME metadata so image attachments keep working for image analysis, with regression coverage for image and non-image payloads. (#104) — thanks @DK625.
- Gemini web: include Chrome/sweet-cookie warnings in missing-cookie failures so app-bound-cookie and SQLite/BigInt extraction problems surface actionable diagnostics instead of a generic auth-cookie error.
- MCP: let `consult` inherit browser defaults from `~/.oracle/config.json` while still honoring explicit tool-call overrides. (#109) — thanks @doodaaatimmy-creator.
- Dependencies: bump `@steipete/sweet-cookie` to `0.2.0`, picking up the Node 22 Chrome-cookie read fix that casts `expires_utc` safely instead of tripping the SQLite BigInt overflow path.

## 0.8.6 — 2026-02-09

### Added

- Sessions: add `oracle restart <id>` to re-run a stored session as a new session (clones options) (#84, thanks @enki).
- Browser: optional periodic auto-reattach attempts after assistant timeouts (`--browser-auto-reattach-delay` / `--browser-auto-reattach-interval` / `--browser-auto-reattach-timeout`). Original PR #87 by Felix Huber (@felix-huber) — thank you!

### Fixed

- Browser: fix memory leaks in browser mode and model resolver cache (#77, thanks @bindscha).
- Browser: fix markdown fallback extractor TDZ crash in browser mode (#90, thanks @julianknutsen).
- CLI: honor `--no-wait` for Commander `--no-` flags (fixes restart wait preference) (#91).

### Changed

- Deps: update dependencies.

## 0.8.5 — 2026-01-19

### Added

- Bridge: add the bridge workflow + MCP browser controls for remote ChatGPT sessions. Original PR #42 by Kyle McCleary (@kmccleary3301) — thank you!
- CLI: add `--background`/`--no-background`, `--http-timeout`, `--zombie-timeout`, and `--zombie-last-activity` to support long-running API sessions.
- Browser: optional delayed recheck after assistant timeouts (`--browser-recheck-delay` / `--browser-recheck-timeout`).
- Browser: add `--browser-profile-lock-timeout` to serialize manual-login runs that share a Chrome profile.

### Fixed

- CLI: restore legacy `--[no-]notify`, `--[no-]notify-sound`, and `--[no-]background` flags as hidden aliases (Commander no longer accepts `[no-]` in `new Option()`).
- Sessions: zombie detection now respects explicit timeouts and can optionally use last log activity to avoid false “zombie” status on long runs.
- Browser: fall back to the default DevTools target if an isolated tab fails, and keep the run tab open when `--keep-browser` is set.
- Browser: refresh long assistant responses without clobbering captured Markdown.
- Browser: keep sessions reattachable when assistant responses time out (e.g., long Pro runs) and log a reattach hint.
- Browser: avoid attaching to the default tab when reusing a shared manual-login Chrome (reduces cross-run interference).

### Changed

- Config: remove legacy `remote.host`/`remote.token` and top-level `remoteHost`/`remoteToken`; use `browser.remoteHost`/`browser.remoteToken` or env vars.

## 0.8.4 — 2026-01-04

### Changed

- Deps: update zod to `4.3.5`.
- Deps: add `qs` as a direct dependency (avoids Dependabot pnpm transitive-update failures).

### Fixed

- Browser: fix attachment uploads in the current ChatGPT composer (avoid duplicate uploads; avoid image-only inputs for non-image files). Original PR #60 by Alex Naidis (@TheCrazyLex) — thank you!

## 0.8.3 — 2025-12-31

### Added

- Config: allow `browser.forceEnglishLocale` to opt into `--lang/--accept-lang` for browser runs.
- Browser: add `--browser-cookie-wait` / `browser.cookieSyncWaitMs` to wait once and retry cookie sync. Original PR #55 by bheemreddy-samsara — thank you!

### Fixed

- Browser: avoid stray attachment removal clicks while still detecting stale chips, and allow completed uploads even if send stays disabled. Original PR #56 by Alex Naidis (@TheCrazyLex) — thank you!
- Browser: dismiss blocking modals when a custom ChatGPT project URL is missing, and harden attachment uploads (force input/change events; retry via DataTransfer; treat “file selected” as insufficient unless the composer shows attachment UI).
- Browser: prefer a trusted (CDP) click on the composer “+” button so attachment uploads work even when ChatGPT ignores synthetic clicks.

## 0.8.2 — 2025-12-30

### Changed

- Release: disable npm progress output in Codex runs via `scripts/release.sh`.

### Docs

- Release checklist now requires GitHub release notes to match the full changelog section.

### Tests

- Live: tolerate truncated prompt echo in browser model selection checks.
- Live: skip mixed OpenRouter assertions when a provider returns empty output.
- Live: wait for browser runtime hint before reattaching in the reattach smoke.

## 0.8.1 — 2025-12-30

### Added

- Config: allow `browser.thinkingTime`, `browser.manualLogin`, and `browser.manualLoginProfileDir` defaults in `~/.oracle/config.json`.

### Fixed

- Browser: thinking-time chip selection now recognizes "Pro" labeled composer pills. Original PR #54 by Alex Naidis (@TheCrazyLex) — thank you!
- Browser: when a custom ChatGPT project URL is missing, retry on the base URL with a longer prompt timeout.
- Browser: increase attachment wait budget and proceed with sending the prompt if completion times out (skip attachment gating/verification).
- CLI: disable OSC progress output when running under Codex (`CODEX_MANAGED_BY_NPM=1`) to avoid spinner noise.

### Tests

- Stabilize OSC progress detection tests when `CODEX_MANAGED_BY_NPM=1` is set.
- Add fast live browser runs for missing-project fallback + attachment uploads (`test:live:fast`).

## 0.8.0 — 2025-12-28

### Highlights

- Browser reliability push: stronger reattach, response capture, and attachment uploads (fewer prompt-echoes, truncations, and duplicate uploads).
- Cookie stack revamp via Sweet Cookie (no native addons) with better inline-cookie handling; Gemini web now works on Windows and honors `--browser-cookie-path`.
- New `--browser-model-strategy` flag to control ChatGPT model selection (`select`/`current`/`ignore`) in browser mode. Original PR #49 by @djangonavarro220 — thank you!

### Improvements

- Browser reattach now preserves `/c/` conversation URLs and project URL prefixes, validates conversation ids, and recovers from mid-run disconnects or capture failures.
- Response capture is more stable: wider selectors, assistant-only copy-turn capture, prompt-echo avoidance, and stop-button/clipboard stability checks.
- Attachment uploads are idempotent and count-aware (composer + chips + file inputs), with explicit completion waits and stale-input cleanup.
- Login flow adds richer diagnostics, auto-accepts the “Welcome back” picker, and always logs the active ChatGPT URL.
- Cookie handling prefers live Chrome over legacy `~/.oracle/cookies.json`; Gemini web can use inline cookies when sync is disabled.

### Fixes

- CLI: stream Markdown via Markdansi’s block renderer and guard the live renderer for non‑TTY edge cases.
- Tests: stabilize browser live tests (serialization + project URL fallback) and add response-observer assertions; browser smoke runs are faster.

## 0.7.6 — 2025-12-25

### Changed

- CLI: compact finish line summary across API, browser, and session views.
- CLI: token counts now render as `↑in ↓out ↻reasoning Δtotal`.

### Fixed

- CLI/Browser: ignore duplicate `--file` inputs (log once) and improve attachment presence detection so re-runs don’t spam “already attached” upload errors.
- Browser: harden session reattach (better conversation targeting, longer prompt-commit wait, avoid closing shared DevTools targets).
- Live tests: add coverage + retries for browser reattach/model selection; tolerate transient OpenRouter free-tier failures.

## 0.7.5 — 2025-12-23

### Fixed

- Packaging: switch tokentally to npm release so Homebrew installs don't trigger git prepare builds.

## 0.7.4 — 2025-12-23

### Changed

- Browser: add `--browser-thinking-time <light|standard|extended|heavy>` to select thinking-time intensity in ChatGPT.

### Fixed

- Browser: throttle attachment upload pokes and pace multi-file uploads to avoid duplicate “already attached” warnings.
- Browser: correct GPT-5.2 variant selection (Auto/Thinking/Instant/Pro) with stricter matching and improved testid scoring; thinking-time selection now supports multiple levels. Original PR #45 by Manish Malhotra (@manmal) — thank you!
- Browser: only reload stalled conversations after an assistant-response failure (and only once), instead of always refreshing after submit.

## 0.7.3 — 2025-12-23

### Changed

- API: streaming answers in a rich TTY now use Markdansi’s live renderer (`createLiveRenderer`) so we can stream _and_ render Markdown in-place.

### Fixed

- Browser: prevent `chrome-launcher` from auto-killing Chrome on SIGINT so reattach sessions survive Ctrl+C.
- Sessions: running browser sessions now mark as errored when the Chrome PID/port are no longer reachable.
- Browser: reattach now recovers even if Chrome was closed by reopening, locating the conversation in the sidebar, and resuming the response.

## 0.7.2 — 2025-12-17

### Fixed

- Browser: stop auto-clicking the “Answer now” gate; wait for the full Pro-thinking response instead of skipping it.
- Browser: reject `?temporary-chat=true` URLs when targeting Pro models (Pro picker entries are not available in Temporary Chat); error message now calls this out explicitly.
- Browser: attachment uploads re-trigger the file-input change event until ChatGPT renders the attachment card (avoids hydration races); verify attachments are present on the sent user message before waiting for the assistant.
- Live tests: make the `gpt-5.2-instant` OpenAI smoke test resilient to transient API stalls/errors.

## 0.7.1 — 2025-12-17

### Changed

- API: default model is now `gpt-5.2-pro` (and “Pro” label inference prefers GPT‑5.2 Pro).
- Tests: updated fixtures/defaults to use `gpt-5.2-pro` instead of `gpt-5.1-pro`.
- API: clarify `gpt-5.1-pro` as a stable alias that targets `gpt-5.2-pro`.
- Browser: browser engine GPT selection now supports ChatGPT 5.2 (`gpt-5.2`) and ChatGPT 5.2 Pro (`gpt-5.2-pro`); legacy labels like `gpt-5.1` normalize to 5.2, and “Pro” always resolves to 5.2 Pro (ignores Legacy GPT‑5.1 Pro submenu) with a top-bar label confirmation.

### Fixed

- Browser: prompt commit verification handles markdown code fences better; prompt-echo recovery is more robust (including remote browser mode); multi-file uploads are less flaky (dynamic timeouts + better filename matching). Original PR #41 by Muly Oved (@mulyoved) — thank you!
- Browser: adapt to ChatGPT DOM changes (`data-turn=assistant|user`) and “Answer now” gating in Pro thinking so we don’t capture placeholders/truncate answers.
- Gemini web: add abortable timeouts + retries for cookie-based runs so live tests are less likely to hang on transient Gemini web responses.

## 0.7.0 — 2025-12-14

### Added

- Browser: Gemini browser mode via direct Gemini web client (uses Chrome cookies; no API key required; runs fully in Node/TypeScript — no Python/venv). Includes `--youtube`, `--generate-image`, `--edit-image`, `--output`, `--aspect`, and `--gemini-show-thoughts`. Original PR #39 by Nico Bailon (@nicobailon) — thank you!
- Browser: media files passed via `--file` (images/video/audio/PDF) are treated as upload attachments instead of being inlined into the prompt (enables Gemini file analysis).
- Browser: Gemini image ops follow `gg-dl` redirects while preserving cookies, so `--generate-image`/`--edit-image` actually create output files.
- Browser: Gemini web runs support “Pro” auto-fallback when unavailable and include compatibility init for Gemini web token changes.
- Live tests: add opt-in Gemini web smoke coverage for image generation/editing (cookie-based browser mode).

### Changed

- Browser guard now allows Gemini models (browser engine supports GPT + Gemini; other models require `--engine api`).

## 0.6.1 — 2025-12-13

### Changed

- Browser: default model target now prefers ChatGPT 5.2. Original PR #40 by Muly Oved (@mulyoved) — thank you!
- Browser: remove the “browser fallback” API retry suggestion to avoid accidental billable reruns. Idea from PR #38 by Nico Bailon (@nicobailon) — thank you!

### Fixed

- Browser: manual-login runs now reuse an already-running Chrome more reliably (persist DevTools port in the profile; probe with retries; clean up stale port state). Original PR #40 by Muly Oved (@mulyoved) — thank you!
- Browser: response capture is less likely to truncate by mistaking earlier turns as complete; completion detection is scoped to the last assistant turn and requires brief stability before capture. Original PR #40 by Muly Oved (@mulyoved) — thank you!
- Browser: stale profile cleanup avoids deleting lock files when an active Chrome process is using the profile.

## 0.6.0 — 2025-12-12

### Added

- GPT-5.2 model support (`gpt-5.2` Thinking, `gpt-5.2-instant`, `gpt-5.2-pro`) plus browser thinking-time automation. Original PR #37 by Nico Bailon (@nicobailon) — thank you!

### Changed

- API: `gpt-5.1-pro` now targets `gpt-5.2-pro` instead of older Pro fallbacks.
- Browser: “Thinking time → Extended” selection now reuses centralized menu selectors, normalizes text matching, and ships a best-effort helper for future “auto” mode. Original PR #36 by Victor Vannara (@voctory) — thank you!
- Browser: new `--browser-attachments <auto|never|always>` (default `auto`) pastes file contents inline up to ~60k characters, then switches to uploads; if ChatGPT rejects an inline paste as too large, Oracle retries automatically with uploads.
  - Note: the ~60k threshold is based on pasted **characters** in the ChatGPT composer (not token estimates); on rejection we log the retry and switch to uploads automatically.

## 0.5.6 — 2025-12-09 (re-release of 0.5.5)

### Changed

- Browser uploads: after `setFileInputFiles` we now log the chips + file-input contents and only mark success when the real file input contains the uploaded filename; the generic “Files” pill is no longer treated as proof of attachment.
- Inline prompt commit: verification now matches on a normalized prefix and logs the last user turn + counts when commit fails, reducing false negatives for inline/file-paste runs.

### Fixed

- Inline fallback (pasting file contents) now reliably submits and captures the user turn; headful smoke confirms the marker text is echoed back.

## 0.5.4 — 2025-12-08

### Changed

- Docs: README now explicitly warns against `pnpx @steipete/oracle` (pnpx cache breaks sqlite bindings); use `npx -y @steipete/oracle` instead. Thanks Xuanwo for flagging this.
- Browser uploads: stick to the single reliable file-input path (no drag/drop fallbacks), wait for the composer to render the new “N files” pill/remove-card UI before sending, and prefer non-image inputs. Thanks Peter for the repros and screenshots that caught the regressions.

### Fixed

- API fallback: gpt-5.1-pro API runs now automatically downgrade to gpt-5.0-pro with a one-line notice (5.1 Pro is not yet available via API).
- Browser uploads: detect ChatGPT’s composer attachment chip (not echoed in the last user turn) to avoid false “Attachment did not appear” failures. Thanks Mariano Belinky (@mbelinky) for the fix.
- Browser interruption: if the user/agent sends SIGINT/SIGTERM/SIGQUIT while the assistant response is still pending, Oracle leaves Chrome running, writes runtime hints, and logs how to reattach with `oracle session <slug>` instead of killing the browser mid-run.
- Browser uploads (ChatGPT UI 2025-12): wait for DOM ready, avoid duplicate uploads, and block Send until the attachment chip/file name (or “N files” pill) is visible so files aren’t sent empty or multiple times.
- Browser i18n: stop-button detection now uses data-testid instead of English `aria-label`; send/input/+ selectors favor data-testid/structural cues to work across localized UIs.

## 0.5.3 — 2025-12-06

### Changed

- `oracle` with no arguments now prints the help/usage banner; launch the interactive UI explicitly via `oracle tui` (keeps `ORACLE_FORCE_TUI` for automation/tests). README updated to match.
- TUI exits gracefully when the terminal drops raw mode (e.g., `setRawMode EIO` after pager issues) instead of looping the paging error; prints a hint to run `stty sane`.
- Ctrl+C in the TUI menu now exits cleanly without printing the paging error loop.
- Exit banner is printed once when leaving the TUI (prevents duplicate “Closing the book” messages after SIGINT or exit actions).

## 0.5.2 — 2025-12-06

### Changed

- Updated Inquirer to 13.x and aligned TUI prompts with `select` to stay compatible with the latest API.
- Browser click automation now uses a shared pointer/mouse event sequence for send/model/copy/stop buttons, improving reliability with React/ProseMirror UIs. Original fix by community contributor Mike Demarais in PR #30—thank you!

### Fixed

- Browser config defaults from `~/.oracle/config.json` now apply when CLI flags are untouched (chromePath/profile/cookiePath), fixing “No Chrome installations found” when a custom browser path is configured.
- Browser engine now verifies each attachment shows up in the composer before sending (including remote/serve uploads), fixing cases where file selection succeeded but ChatGPT never received the files (e.g., WKWebView blank runs).

## 0.5.1 — 2025-12-03

### Added

- Browser runs now auto-click the ChatGPT “Answer now” gate after sending, so workspace prompts continue without manual intervention.

### Changed

- `oracle status` uses the same session table formatting as the TUI (status/model/mode/timestamp/chars/cost/slug) for consistent layout.
- Browser mode inserts a 500 ms settle before submitting prompts and after clicking gates to avoid subscription/widget races.
- OpenRouter paths route through the chat/completions API (Responses API avoided); live smokes use `z-ai/glm-4.6`, and the mixed run covers Grok fast path without skips.
- Docs/guardrails: AGENTS explains sqlite/keytar rebuilds for Node 25 browser runs; changelog notes the browser cookie-sync guard.

### Fixed

- Browser mode fails fast when cookie sync copies zero cookies (e.g., keytar not built); the error names the Chrome profile and rebuild command instead of silently hanging.

## 0.5.0 — 2025-11-25

### Added

- Browser sessions now persist Chrome reattach hints (port/host/target/url) and log them inline; `oracle session <id>` can reconnect to a live tab, harvest the assistant turn, and mark the run completed even if the original controller died. Includes a reconnection helper and regression tests for runtime hint capture and reattach.
- OpenRouter support: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` auto-routes API runs (when provider keys are missing or the base URL points at OpenRouter), accepts arbitrary model ids (`minimax/minimax-m2`, `z-ai/glm-4.6`, etc.), mixes with built-in models in `--models`, passes attribution headers (`OPENROUTER_REFERER`/`OPENROUTER_TITLE`), and stores per-model logs with safe slugs.
- `pnpm test:browser` runs a Chrome DevTools connectivity check plus headless browser smokes across GPT-5.1 / GPT-5.1-Pro / 5.1 Instant.

### Changed

- All API errors now surface as transport reason `api-error` with the raw message and are shown in status/render/TUI; verbose mode still prints transport details. Multi-model callback order test stabilized.
- Default system prompt no longer asks models to announce when the search tool was used.
- API now surfaces a clear error when `gpt-5.1-pro` isn’t available yet (suggests using `gpt-5-pro`); remove once OpenAI enables the model.
- Dependency refresh: openai 6.9.1, clipboardy 5, Vitest 4.0.13 (+ coverage), Biome 2.3.7, puppeteer-core 24.31.0, devtools-protocol 0.0.1548823; pinned zod-to-json-schema to 3.24.1 to stay compatible with zod 3.x.

### Fixed

- CLI/TUI now print the intro banner only once; forced TUI launches (`ORACLE_FORCE_TUI` or no args in a TTY) no longer show duplicate 🧿 header lines.
- TUI session list cleans up separators, removing the `__disabled__ (Disabled)` placeholder and `(Disabled)` tag on the header row.
- `oracle session --render` no longer drops answers when the model filter is empty or per-model logs are missing (common for browser runs); stored session output is rendered again.
- Browser uploads no longer time out in ChatGPT project workspaces: file input/send-button selectors are broader, upload completion falls back to attached files when buttons are missing, and we added tests to guard the new selectors.
- Live tests now call out that `gpt-5.1` must be reached via api.openai.com; OpenRouter’s Responses API endpoint doesn’t expose `openai/gpt-5.1`, so runs will fail there with `model_not_found` until they add it.
- Browser reattach flow survives controller loss: the controller PID is persisted with the Chrome port/URL so `oracle session <id>` can reconnect, harvest the assistant turn, and mark the run completed even if the original process died.
- Live multi-model smokes force first-party API bases and soft-skip HTML/transport errors (e.g., proxy 404 pages) so missing provider access doesn’t fail the suite.
- Gemini live coverage confirmed with `gemini-2.5-flash-lite` after refreshing `GEMINI_API_KEY`; multi-model live now passes end-to-end when first-party keys are present.
- Token usage formatter again emits two-decimal abbreviations for thousands (e.g., 4.25k) to match CLI output and tests.

### Added

- `--browser-manual-login` skips cookie copy, reuses a persistent automation profile (`~/.oracle/browser-profile` by default), and waits for manual ChatGPT login—handy on Windows where app-bound cookies can’t be decrypted; works as an opt-in on macOS/Linux too.
- Manual-login browser sessions can reuse an already-running automation Chrome when remote debugging is enabled; point Oracle at it via `--remote-chrome <host:port>` to avoid relaunching/locks.
- `--browser-port` (alias `--browser-debug-port`, env `ORACLE_BROWSER_PORT`) pins the DevTools port so WSL/Windows users can open a single firewall rule; includes a lightweight `pnpm test:browser` DevTools reachability check.

### Changed

- Windows cookie reader now accepts any `v**` AES-GCM prefix (v10/v11/v20) to stay forward compatible.
- On Windows, cookie sync is disabled by default and manual-login is forced; use inline cookies or `--browser-manual-login` (default) instead of profile-based cookie copy.

## 0.4.5 — 2025-11-22

### Fixed

- MCP/API responses now report 404/405 from `/v1/responses` as “unsupported-endpoint” with guidance to fix base URLs/gateways or use browser engine; avoids silent failures when proxies lack the Responses API.

## 0.4.4 — 2025-11-22

### Fixed

- MCP/API runs now surface 404/405 Responses API failures as “unsupported-endpoint” with actionable guidance (check OPENAI_BASE_URL/Azure setup or use the browser engine) instead of a generic transport error.
- Publish metadata now declares Node >=20 (engines/devEngines) and drops the implicit bun runtime so `npx @steipete/oracle` no longer fails with EBADDEVENGINES on newer Node versions.

## 0.4.3 — 2025-11-22

### Added

- xAI Grok 4.1 API support (`--model grok-4.1` / alias `grok`): defaults to `https://api.x.ai/v1`, uses `XAI_API_KEY`, maps search to `web_search`, and includes docs + live smoke.
- Per-model search tool selection so Grok can use `web_search` while OpenAI models keep `web_search_preview`.
- Multi-model coverage now includes Grok in orchestrator tests.
- Grok “thinking”/non-fast variant is not available via API yet; Oracle aliases `grok` to the fast reasoning model to match what xAI ships today.
- PTY-driven CLI/TUI harness landed for e2e coverage (browser guard, TUI exit path); PTY suites are opt-in via `ORACLE_ENABLE_PTY_TESTS=1` and stub tokenizers to stay lightweight.

### Fixed

- MCP (global installs): keep the stdio transport alive until the client closes it so `oracle-mcp` doesn’t exit right after `connect()`; npm -g / host-spawned MCP clients now handshake successfully (tarball regression in 0.4.2).

## 0.4.2 — 2025-11-21

### Fixed

- MCP: `npx @steipete/oracle oracle-mcp` now routes directly to the MCP server (even when npx defaults to the CLI binary) and keeps stdout JSON-only for Cursor/other MCP hosts.
- Added the missing `@anthropic-ai/tokenizer` runtime dependency so `npx @steipete/oracle oracle-mcp` starts cleanly.

## 0.4.1 — 2025-11-21

### Fixed

- Removed duplicate MCP release note entry; no code changes (meta cleanup only).

## 0.4.0 — 2025-11-21

### Added

- Remote Chrome + remote browser service: `oracle serve` launches Chrome with host/token defaults for cross-machine runs, requires the host profile to be signed in, and supports reusing an existing Chrome via `--remote-chrome <host:port>` (IPv6 with `[host]:port`), including remote attachment uploads and clearer validation errors.
- Linux browser support: Chrome/Chromium/Edge runs now work on Linux (including snap-installed Chromium) with cookie sync picking up the snap profile paths. See [docs/linux.md](docs/linux.md) for paths and display guidance.
- Browser engine can target Chromium/Edge by pairing `--browser-chrome-path` with the new `--browser-cookie-path` (also configurable via `browser.chromePath` / `browser.chromeCookiePath`). See [docs/chromium-forks.md](docs/chromium-forks.md) for OS-specific paths and setup steps.
- Markdown bundles render better in the CLI and ChatGPT: each attached file now appears as `### File: <path>` followed by a fenced code block (language inferred), across API bundles, browser bundles (including inline mode), and render/dry-run output; ANSI highlighting still applies on rich TTYs.
- `--render-plain` forces plain markdown output (no ANSI/highlighting) even in a rich TTY; takes precedence when combined with `--render` / `--render-markdown`.
- `--write-output <path>` saves just the final assistant message to disk (adds `.<model>` per file for multi-model runs), with safe path guards and non-fatal write failures.
- Browser engine: `--chatgpt-url` (alias `--browser-url`) and `browser.chatgptUrl` config let you target specific ChatGPT workspace/folder URLs while keeping API `--base-url` separate.
- Multi-model API runner orchestrates multiple API models in one command and aggregates usage/cost; browser engine stays single-model.
- GPT-5.1 Pro API support (new default) and `gpt-5-pro` alias for earlier Pro rollout; GPT-5.1 Codex (API-only) now works end-to-end with high reasoning and auto-forces the API engine. GPT-5.1 Codex Max isn’t available via API yet; the CLI rejects that model until OpenAI ships it.
- Duplicate prompt guard remains active: Oracle blocks a second run when the exact prompt is already running.

### Changed

- Cookie sync covers Chrome, Chromium, Edge, Brave, and Vivaldi profiles; targets chatgpt.com, chat.openai.com, and atlas.openai.com. Windows browser automation is still partial—prefer API or clipboard fallback there.
- Reject prompts shorter than 10 characters with a friendly hint for pro-tier models (`gpt-5.1-pro`) only (prevents accidental costly runs while leaving cheaper models unblocked). Override via ORACLE_MIN_PROMPT_CHARS for automated environments.
- Browser engine default timeout bumped from 15m (900s) to 20m (1200s) so long GPT-5.x Pro responses don’t get cut off; CLI docs/help text now reflect the new ceiling.
- Duration flags such as `--browser-timeout`/`--browser-input-timeout` now accept chained units (`1h2m10s`, `3m10s`, etc.) plus `h`, `m`, `s`, or `ms` suffixes, matching the formats we already log.
- GPT-5.1 Pro and GPT-5 Pro API runs now default to a 60-minute timeout (was 20m) and the “zombie” detector waits the same hour before marking sessions as `error`; CLI messaging/docs updated accordingly so a single “auto” limit covers both behaviors.
- Browser-to-API coercion now happens automatically for GPT-5.1 Codex and Gemini (with a console hint) instead of failing when `--engine browser` is set.
- Browser engine now fails fast (with guidance) when explicitly requested alongside non-GPT models such as Grok, Claude, or Gemini; pick `--engine api` for those.
- Multi-model output is easier to scan: aggregate header/summary, deduped per-model headings, and on-demand OSC progress when replaying combined logs.
- `--write-output` adds stricter path safety, rejecting unsafe destinations while keeping writes non-fatal to avoid breaking runs.
- Session slugs now trim individual words to 10 characters to keep auto-generated IDs readable when prompts include very long tokens.
- CLI: `--mode` is now a silent alias for `--engine` for backward compatibility with older docs/scripts; prefer `--engine`.
- CLI guardrail: if a session with the same prompt is already running, new runs abort with guidance to reattach unless `--force` is provided (prevents unintended duplicate API/browser runs).

### Fixed

- Browser assistant capture is more resilient: markdown cleanup no longer drops real answers and prompt-echo recovery keeps the assistant text intact.
- Browser cookie sync on Windows now copies the profile DB into a named temp directory with the expected `Cookies` filename so `chrome-cookies-secure` can read it reliably during browser fallbacks.
- Streaming runs in `--render-plain` mode now send chunks directly to stdout and keep the log sink newline-aligned, preventing missing or double-printed output in TTY and background runs.
- CLI output is consistent again: final answers always print to stdout (even when a log sink is active) and inline runs once more echo the assistant text to stdout.
- MCP: stdout is now muted during MCP runs, preventing non-JSON logs from breaking hosts like Cursor.

## 0.3.0 — 2025-11-19

### Added

- Native Azure OpenAI support! Set `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` (plus `AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY` and optionally `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT`/`AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION`) or use the new CLI flags (`--azure-endpoint`, `--azure-deployment`, etc.) to switch automatically to the Azure client.
- **Gemini 3 Pro Support**: Use Google's latest model via `oracle --model gemini`. Requires `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
- Configurable API timeout: `--timeout <seconds|auto>` (auto = 20m for most models, 60m for pro models such as gpt-5.1-pro as of 0.4.0). Enforced for streaming and background runs.
- OpenAI-compatible base URL override: `--base-url` (or `apiBaseUrl` in config / `OPENAI_BASE_URL`) lets you target LiteLLM proxies, Azure gateways, and other compatible hosts.
- Help text tip: best results come from 6–30 sentences plus key source files; very short prompts tend to be generic.
- Browser inline cookies: `--browser-inline-cookies[(-file)]` (or env) accepts JSON/base64 payloads, auto-loads `~/.oracle/cookies.{json,base64}`, adds a cookie allowlist (`--browser-cookie-names`), and dry-run now reports whether cookies come from Chrome or inline sources.
- Inline runs now print a single completion line (removed duplicate “Finished” summary), keeping output concise.
- Gemini runs stay on API (no browser detours), and the CLI logs the resolved model id alongside masked keys when it differs.
- `--dry-run [summary|json|full]` is now the single preview flag; `--preview` remains as a hidden alias for compatibility.

### Changed

- Browser engine is now macOS-only; Windows and Linux runs fail fast with guidance to re-run via `--engine api`. Cross-platform browser support is in progress.
- Browser fallback tips focus on `--browser-bundle-files`, making it clear users can drag the single bundled file into ChatGPT when automation fails.
- Sessions TUI separates recent vs older runs, adds an Older/Newer action, keeps headers aligned with rows, and avoids separator crashes while preserving an always-selectable “ask oracle” entry.
- CLI output is tidier and more resilient: graceful Ctrl+C, shorter headers/footers, clearer verbose token labels, and reduced trailing spacing.
- File discovery is more reliable on Windows thanks to normalized paths, native-fs glob handling, and `.gitignore` respect across platforms.

## 0.2.0 — 2025-11-18

### Added

- `oracle-mcp` stdio server (bin) with `consult` and `sessions` tools plus read-only session resources at `oracle-session://{id}/{metadata|log|request}`.
- MCP logging notifications for consult streaming (info/debug with byte sizes); browser engine guardrails now check Chrome availability before a browser run starts.
- Hidden root-level aliases `--message` (prompt) and `--include` (files) to mirror common agent calling conventions.
- `--preview` now works with `--engine browser`, emitting the composed browser payload (token estimate, attachment list, optional JSON/full dumps) without launching Chrome or requiring an API key.
- New `--browser-bundle-files` flag to opt into bundling all attachments into a single upload; bundling is still auto-applied when more than 10 files are provided.
- Desktop session notifications (default on unless CI/SSH) with `--[no-]notify` and optional `--notify-sound`; completed runs announce session name, API cost, and character count via OS-native toasts.
- Per-user JSON5 config at `~/.oracle/config.json` to set default engine/model, notification prefs (including sound/mute rules), browser defaults, heartbeat, file-reporting, background mode, and prompt suffixes. CLI/env still override config.
- Session lists now show headers plus a cost column for quick scanning.

### Changed

- Browser model picker is now more robust: longer menu-open window, richer tokens/testids for GPT-5.1 and GPT-5 Pro, fallback snapshot logging, and best-effort selection to reduce “model not found” errors.
- MCP consult honors notification settings so the macOS Swift notifier fires for MCP-triggered runs.
- `sessions` tool now returns a summary row for `id` lookups by default; pass `detail: true` to fetch full metadata/log/request to avoid large accidental payloads.
- Directory/glob expansions now honor `.gitignore` files and skip dotfiles by default; explicitly matching patterns (e.g., `--file "src/**/.keep"`) still opt in.
- Default ignores when crawling project roots now drop common build/cache folders (`node_modules`, `dist`, `coverage`, `.git`, `.turbo`, `.next`, `build`, `tmp`) unless the path is passed explicitly. Oracle logs each skipped path for transparency.
- Browser engine now logs a one-line warning before cookie sync, noting macOS may prompt for a Keychain password and how to bypass via `--browser-no-cookie-sync` or `--browser-allow-cookie-errors`.
- gpt-5.1-pro API runs default to non-blocking; add `--wait` to block. `gpt-5.1` and browser runs still block by default. CLI now polls once for `in_progress` responses before failing.
- macOS notifier helper now ships signed/notarized with the Oracle icon and auto-repairs execute bits for the fallback terminal-notifier.
- Session summaries and cost displays are clearer, with zombie-session detection to avoid stale runs.
- Token estimation now uses the full request body (instructions + input text + tools/reasoning/background/store) and compares estimated vs actual tokens in the finished stats to reduce 400/413 surprises.
- Help banner and first tip now require “prompt + --file” (dirs/globs fine) and remind you Oracle can’t see your project without attachments.
- Help tips/examples now call out project/platform/version requirements and show how to label cross-repo attachments so the model has the right context.

#### MCP configuration (quick reference)

- Local stdio (mcporter): add to `config/mcporter.json`
  ```json
  {
    "name": "oracle",
    "type": "stdio",
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "@steipete/oracle", "oracle-mcp"]
  }
  ```
- Claude Code (global/user scope):  
  `claude mcp add --scope user --transport stdio oracle -- oracle-mcp`
- Project-scoped Claude: drop `.mcp.json` next to the repo root with
  ```json
  {
    "mcpServers": {
      "oracle": {
        "type": "stdio",
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@steipete/oracle", "oracle-mcp"]
      }
    }
  }
  ```
- The MCP `consult` tool honors `~/.oracle/config.json` defaults (engine/model/search/prompt suffix/heartbeat/background/filesReport) unless the caller overrides them.

## 0.1.1 — 2025-11-20

### Added

- Hidden `--files`, `--path`, and `--paths` aliases for `--file`, so all path inputs (including `--include`) merge cleanly; commas still split within a single flag.
- CLI path-merging helper now has unit coverage for alias ordering and comma splitting.
- New `--copy-markdown` flag (alias `--copy`) assembles the markdown bundle and copies it to the clipboard, printing a one-line summary; combine with `--render-markdown` to both print and copy. Clipboard handling now uses `clipboardy` for macOS/Windows/Linux/Wayland/Termux/WSL with graceful failure messaging.

## 0.1.0 — 2025-11-17

Highlights

- Markdown rendering for completed sessions (`oracle session|status <id> --render` / `--render-markdown`) with ANSI formatting in rich TTYs; falls back to raw when logs are huge or stdout isn’t a TTY.
- New `--path` flag on `oracle session <id>` prints the stored session directory plus metadata/request/log files, erroring if anything is missing. Uses soft color in rich terminals for quick scanning.

Details

### Added

- `oracle session <id> --path` now prints the on-disk session directory plus metadata/request/log files, exiting with an error when any expected file is missing instead of attaching.
- When run in a rich TTY, `--path` labels and paths are colorized for easier scanning.

### Improved

- `oracle session|status <id> --render` (alias `--render-markdown`) pretty-prints completed session markdown to ANSI in rich TTYs, falls back to raw when non-TTY or oversized logs.

## 0.0.10 — 2025-11-17

### Added

- Rich terminals that support OSC 9;4 (Ghostty 1.2+, WezTerm, Windows Terminal) now show an inline progress bar while Oracle waits for the OpenAI response; disable with `ORACLE_NO_OSC_PROGRESS=1`, force with `ORACLE_FORCE_OSC_PROGRESS=1`.

## 0.0.9 — 2025-11-16

### Added

- `oracle session|status <id> --render` (alias `--render-markdown`) pretty-prints completed session markdown to ANSI in rich TTYs, falls back to raw when non-TTY or oversized logs.
- Hidden root-level `--session <id>` alias attaches directly to a stored session (for agents/automation).
- README now recommends preferring API engine for reliability and longer uninterrupted runs when an API key is available.
- Session rendering now uses Markdansi (micromark/mdast-based), removing markdown-it-terminal and eliminating HTML leakage/crashes during replays.
- Added a local Markdansi type shim for now; switch to official types once the npm package ships them.
- Markdansi renderer now enables color/hyperlinks when TTY by default and auto-renders sessions unless the user explicitly disables it.

## 0.0.8 — 2025-11-16

### Changed

- Help tips call out that Oracle is one-shot and does not remember prior runs, so every query should include full context.
- `oracle session <id>` now logs a brief notice when extra root-only flags are present (e.g., `--render-markdown`) to make it clear those options are ignored during reattach.

## 0.0.7 — 2025-11-16

### Changed

- Browser-mode thinking monitor now emits a text-only progress bar instead of the "Pro thinking" string.
- `oracle session <id>` trims preamble/log noise and prints from the first `Answer:` line once a session is finished.
- Help tips now stress sending whole directories and richer project briefings for better answers.

## 0.0.6 — 2025-11-15

### Changed

- Colorized live run header (model/tokens/files) when a rich TTY is available.
- Added a blank line before the `Answer:` prefix for readability.
- Masked API key logging now shows first/last 4 characters (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-p****qfAA`).
- Suppressed duplicate session header on reattach and removed repeated background response IDs in heartbeats.

### Browser mode

- When more than 10 files are provided, automatically bundles all files into a single `attachments-bundle.txt` to stay under ChatGPT’s upload cap and logs a verbose warning when bundling occurs.

## 0.0.5 — 2025-11-15

### Added

- Logs the masked OpenAI key in use (`Using OPENAI_API_KEY=xxxx****yyyy`) so runs are traceable without leaking secrets.
- Logs a helpful tip when you run without attachments, reminding you to pass context via `--file`.

## 0.0.3 — 2025-11-15

## 0.0.2 — 2025-11-15

### Added

- Positional prompt shorthand: `oracle "prompt here"` (and `npx -y @steipete/oracle "..."`) now maps the positional argument to `--prompt` automatically.

### Fixed

- `oracle status/session` missing-prompt guard now coexists with the positional prompt path and still shows the cleanup tip when no sessions exist.

## 0.0.1 — 2025-11-15

### Fixed

- Corrected npm binary mapping so `oracle` is installed as an executable. Published with `--tag beta`.

## 0.0.0 — 2025-11-15

### Added

- Dual-engine support (API and browser) with automatic selection: defaults to API when `OPENAI_API_KEY` is set, otherwise falls back to browser mode.
- Session-friendly prompt guard that allows `status`/`session` commands to run without a prompt while still enforcing prompts for normal runs, previews, and dry runs.
- Browser mode uploads each `--file` individually and logs Chrome PID/port for detachable runs.
- Background GPT-5 Pro runs with heartbeat logging and reconnect support for long responses.
- File token accounting (`--files-report`) and dry-run summaries for both engines.
- Comprehensive CLI and browser automation test suites, including engine selection and prompt requirement coverage.

### Changed

- Help text, README, and browser-mode docs now describe the auto engine fallback and the deprecated `--browser` alias.
- CLI engine resolution is centralized to keep legacy flags, model inference, and environment defaults consistent.

### Fixed

- `oracle status` and `oracle session` no longer demand `--prompt` when used directly.
